## Background

TravelersPin was my first ever app on the AppStore. While the app is very similar to many popular apps on the AppStore, I wanted to build something to demonstrate and apply what I have learned with Swift/iOS including the following areas:

* Server side via CloudKit
* Realm/CoreData
* Maps
* Images
* Camera & Photo Library
* Geolocation 

In addition, I want to showcase some of my design skills. I want to thank **Design + Code** for showing me how important design is in order to become a more complete developer.
